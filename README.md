## Hi, my name is Jakub ðŸ‘‹

I am an analog integrated circuit designer during the office hours, but in my free time, I like to code software or tinker with microcontrollers and electronic hardware.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Home Air Monitoring System](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Home-Air-Monitoring-System)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning digital design within my [Nexys A7 lab](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Nexys-A7-Lab) repository
- âš¡ My proudest coding achievement is [Kapytal](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Kapytal) - a personal finance management desktop app for Windows
- ðŸ’¬ My favourite language is Python, but I program microcontrollers in C or C++ and FPGAs in VHDL
