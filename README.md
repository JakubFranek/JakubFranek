## Hi, my name is Jakub 👋

I am an analog integrated circuit designer during the office hours, but in my free time, I like to code software or tinker with microcontrollers and other electronic hardware.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Nexys A7 lab](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Nexys-A7-Lab) - a personal repository for re-learning FPGA development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VHDL, PSL, VUnit, (Symbi)Yosys
- ⚡ My proudest coding achievement is [Kapytal](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Kapytal) - a personal finance management desktop app for Windows
- 🛠️ My proudest hardware & embedded software achievement is [Home Air Monitoring System](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Home-Air-Monitoring-System)
- 💬 My favourite language is Python, but I program microcontrollers in C or C++ and FPGAs in VHDL
