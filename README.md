## Hi, my name is Jakub ðŸ‘‹

I am an analog design integrated circuit designer by trade, but in my free time, I like to write software or tinker with microcontrollers and electronic hardware.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Home Air Monitoring System](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Home-Air-Monitoring-System)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [STM32](https://github.com/JakubFranek/STM32) and [ESP32](https://github.com/JakubFranek/ESP32) microcontroller platforms
- âš¡ My proudest coding achievement is [Kapytal](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Kapytal) - a personal finance management desktop app for Windows
- ðŸ’¬ My favourite language is Python, but I program my microcontrollers in C or C++
